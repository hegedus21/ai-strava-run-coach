# StravAI Coach 🏃‍♂️🤖

> **Elite performance coaching powered by Gemini 3 Pro. From raw GPS data to professional prescriptions.**

StravAI is an autonomous coaching engine designed for athletes who demand professional-grade analysis without the premium price tag. It processes your Strava activities via real-time webhooks, analyzes them against your training history, and writes detailed coaching reports directly into your activity descriptions.

## 🌟 Key Features

*   **Pro Reasoning Engine:** Switched to `gemini-3-pro-preview` to handle complex multi-workout historical analysis and specific physiological prescriptions.
*   **Dual-AI Architecture:** A service *built by* AI to be *powered by* AI. Developed using GenAI to compress months of work into a single afternoon.
*   **Deep Narrative Intelligence:** The Coach remembers. It doesn't just look at one run; it analyzes historical trends to detect *Aerobic Decoupling*, *Structural Integrity*, and recovery patterns.
*   **Zero-Cost Operation:** Strategically engineered for the free cloud ecosystem:
    *   **Backend:** .NET 9 Minimal API hosted on **Koyeb**.
    *   **Intelligence:** **Gemini 3 Pro** (Free Tier) for elite-tier reasoning.
    *   **Automation:** **GitHub Actions** for headless synchronization.
*   **Interactive Feedback Loop:** Add athlete notes (e.g., *"Legs felt heavy"*) to your activity description, and the AI Coach will incorporate your subjective feel into the next prescription.

## 💡 Engineering Philosophy
This project demonstrates the power of **AI-Native Development**. By utilizing AI as a co-pilot, I bypassed the friction of API documentation and boilerplate, focusing entirely on the **data architecture** and **coaching logic**. The result is a production-grade performance engine maintained for $0/month.
